Last updated: December 14, 2009

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Google Maps Data API. The Google Maps 
Data API allows you to view and update maps and map features, and to provide 
content for Google to host and make accessible online.</p>

<h1 class="page_title" style="margin-right: 0px; background-image: none;">
        <b><font size="3">Maps Data API Terms of Service</font></b>
      </h1>
      
<div id="pagecontent">
        
<h1 style="margin-right: 0px; background-color: rgb(229, 236, 249);">
          <b><font size="3">1. Your relationship with Google</font></b>
        </h1>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.1 Your use of the Google Maps Data API (referred to as "the Maps Data API" or the "Service" in this document) is subject to these Terms of Service, which constitute a legal agreement between you and Google. "Google" means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, these terms and conditions as set forth in this document, along with the then-current version of the documentation related to the Maps Data API located at <span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapsdata" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 204);">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapsdata,&nbsp;</a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><font size="3">&nbsp;and the Google Maps / Google Earth Terms of Service located at&nbsp;<a href="http://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">http://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html&nbsp;</a>(collectively, the “Terms of Service”).</font></span></span></font></p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.3 If you use the Maps Data API in conjunction with any other Google services, your agreement with Google will also include the terms of service applicable to those service. All of these are referred to below as the "Additional Terms." Where Additional Terms apply to a Google product, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that product.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.4 The Terms of Service, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the Maps Data API and any additional Google services (collectively referred to as the "Services"). It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the "Terms."</font></p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Terms of Service say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.6 You represent and warrant that you have full authority to accept the Terms. If you are accepting on behalf of someone else, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind that person or entity to these Terms. If you don’t have full legal authority to bind, please ensure that an authorized person from your entity consents to and accepts the Terms.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">1.7 As used in this agreement, your “Application” means any software, web site, or embedded application you develop that can access or communicate with Google’s servers using the Maps Data API.&nbsp;</font></p>
        
<h1 style="margin-right: 0px; background-color: rgb(229, 236, 249);">

<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">2.1 In order to use the Maps Data API, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Maps Data API if you do not accept the Terms.</font>
        </p>

          <font size="3">2.2 You can accept the Terms by:</font>

<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for any Service; or</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">(B) by actually using the Maps Data API. In this case, you understand and agree that Google will treat your use of the Maps Data API as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">
          <font size="3">2.3 You may not use the Maps Data API and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the Maps Data API under the laws of the United States.&nbsp;</font></p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">

When these changes are made, Google will make a new copy of the Terms of Service available and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.</font>

<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and govern your use of the Service (and excluding any Services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement or terms of service), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Service.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</font>
        </p>
        
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="3">19.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</font>
