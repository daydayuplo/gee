        <p>
          Once you have become familiar with the basic steps involved in creating and organizing
          places and folders, you can use this section to learn how you can further modify the
          appearance of places and folders that you have saved. You can edit the style settings,
          position, and view for an individual placemark or a folder that contains place data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on the icon or folder in the
          <em>Places</em> panel and select <em>Properties</em> from the pop-up menu. The
          <em>Edit</em> dialog box for that item appears. Enable the relevant <em>Style</em>,
          <em>Location</em>, and <em>View</em> properties for the folder or placemark.
        </p>
        <div class="note">

        <h2>
          <a id="respositioning" name="respositioning"></a>Repositioning Placemarks
        </h2>
        <p>
          When editing placemarks or geometry, you might want to reposition their location on the
          earth. The <em>Edit Placemark</em> dialog box offers a number of ways to <a href=
          "#dragging">reposition a placemark</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="dragging" name="dragging"></a>Dragging the Placemark
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you edit a placemark, a yellow square appears around the icon, indicating that you
          can reposition the icon if you desire. Just click within the square and drag the icon to
          the new location. If you need to move the earth to get a better view of the icon relative
          to other things, position the mouse outside the square to move the 3D viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also <a href="#locking">lock the placemark to the center of the view</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="locking" name="locking"></a>Locking a Placemark to the Center of the View
        </h3>
        <p>
          With this feature, you reposition the earth under the placemark, rather than
          repositioning the placemark over the earth. This feature is useful if you want to move a
          placemark a distance that extends beyond the view, and using drag and drop is
          inconvenient as you switch from dragging the icon to repositioning the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on the <em>View</em> tab and select the <em>Center in View</em> check box. When you
          choose this option, the placemark moves to the center of the 3D viewer and cannot be
          repositioned by dragging. Instead, you position the icon by <em>dragging the earth</em>,
          which then moves independently of the placemark. This feature allows you to easily
          position an icon to a new location beyond your current screen space.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="entering" name="entering"></a>Entering Advanced Coordinates

        <p class="note">
          <strong>Tip</strong> - You can <a href="ug_3dviewer.html#viewprefs">change how Google
          Earth displays coodinates</a> in the 3D viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know the latitude and longitude for the placemark you are editing, click the View
          tab and enter coordinates to reposition the geographic point for the placemark. The
          placemark adjusts its position to the new values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Latitude and Longitude</strong> values can be set using the following notations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Decimal Degrees</strong> (DDD) - In this notation, decimal precision is set in
            the <em>degree</em> coordinate. For example, 49.11675953666N.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds</strong> (DMS) - In this notation, decimal
            precision is set in the <em>seconds</em> coordinate. For example, 49 7'20.06"N.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Degrees, Minutes with Decimal Seconds</strong> (DMM) - In this notation,
            decimal precision is set in the <em>minutes</em> coordinate. For example, 49
            7.0055722"N. (Here, 20.06 seconds above is divided by 3600 to get the decimal minute
            value for 20.06 seconds.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Latitude and Longitude syntax is specified as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Numeric Values</strong> - Simply separate each coordinate notation with a white
            space and the entry will be recognized correctly. For example, you can indicate a DMS
            notation as: 37 24 23.3. You could indicate a DMM notation as 49 7.0055722.<br>
            <br>
            You can also use the single quote mark (') for minutes and the double quote mark (")
            for seconds, as follows: 49 7'20.06"<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, you can use the Character Map utility in Windows to copy the degree
            symbol and paste it into the Latitude/Longitude input boxes. To do this, select Start -
            All Programs - Accessories - System Tools, and then click Character Map. The degree
            symbol with Arial font is the second entry past the registration symbol. Click on the
            symbol, click the Copy button and paste it into the input box.<br>
            <br>
            On the Mac, open TextEdit. Press Shift + Option +8. The degree symbol appears. Copy and
            paste this into the input box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Direction Notation (North/South, East/West)</strong><br>
            <br>
            Use <em>N</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>E</em>, or <em>W</em> to indicate direction. The letter
            can be entered either upper or lower case and it can be placed before or after the
            coordinate value. For example:<br>
            N 37 24 23.3 is the same as 37 24 23.3 N<br>
            <br>
            You can also use the minus sign (-) to indicate a westerly or southerly position. When
            you use this kind of notation, do not specify a letter symbol. Additionally, you do not
            need to use a plus sign (+) to indicate northerly/easterly directions. So, for example
            this is a valid entry:<br>
            37 25 19.07, -122 05 08.40<br>
            <br>
            The following is NOT a valid entry:<br>
            37 25 19.07 N, -122 05 08.40
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Entering Latitude, Longitude Pairs</strong><br>
            <br>
            When entering latitudinal or longitudinal pairs, the first coordinate is interpreted as
            latitude unless you use a direction letter to clarify (E or W). For example, you can
            enter longitude first as:<br>
            122 05 08.40 W 37 25 19.07 N<br>
            <br>
            However, you cannot use the minus sign to enter longitude first:<br>
            -122 05 08.40 37 25 19.07<br>
            <br>
            You can separate pair entries with a space, a comma, or a slash:<br>
            37.7 N 122.2 W<br>
            37.7 N,122.2 W<br>
            37.7 N/122.2 W
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Tip</strong> - When entering advanced coordinates, the location for your
          placemark will adjust as soon as your cursor exits the input box, but the view will
          remain the same. Your placemark will seem to disappear from view. To see the placemark in
          the 3D viewer, click the <em>View</em> tab and click the <em>Reset to default view</em>
          button. Your 3D viewer will now be positioned over the placemark in its new location.
        </div>
        <h3>
          <a id="setview" name="setview"></a>Setting the View
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you create a new placemark, the view for that placemark (i.e., how it is seen in the
          3D viewer) is automatically set to the current view on creation. However, you can change
          the view for any placemark and save it so that each visit to the placemark shows the
          saved view. This involves specifying a particular orientation around a given place and
          then setting the orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, after first viewing a particular place, you might subsequently find a
          position that you like to view it from, such as at a specific tilt angle and from a
          southerly direction. Rather than the default north-south, overhead viewpoint of a
          location, you can specify your preferred position as the view for every time you visit.

          First, position the 3D viewer at the viewing orientation you desire and then choose one
          of the following options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on the item</strong> in the list view or
            the 3D view and select <em>Snapshot View</em> from the pop-up menu.<br>
            <br>
            The current view inside the Google Earth client 3D viewer is then set as the view for
            the selected placemark or folder. You can examine the actual settings for the view by
            editing the placemark or folder and clicking on the <em>View</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edit the placemark or folder</strong> - Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on
            the folder or icon and select <em>Properties</em> from the pop-up menu. Click on the
            <em>View</em> tab in the Edit... dialog box. The current values for the view are
            displayed. When you are ready to set the view (you can still position the view at this
            point), click on the <em>Snapshot current view</em> button.<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, you can manually enter the settings if you have them. Click the
            <em>OK</em> button to see the changes in the 3D viewer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - When you change the values for a view, the 3D viewer changes

          can also change the following features for a label.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Color</strong> - To set the color for a label, click on the <em>Color</em>
            swatch and choose a color using the standard color selector. You can choose preset
            colors or define your own in a variety of ways. When you select this color, the label
            updates before the <em>Edit</em> dialog box is closed, so you can view your changes and
            modify them easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Size</strong> - To change the display size for a label, enter a value in the
            <em>Scale</em> field or click on the <em>Scale</em> button and use the slider to adjust
            the size of the label to your preference. The maximum scale value for an icon is 4
            pixels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opacity</strong> - The opacity setting indicates how transparent the label is
            relative to the imagery beneath it. By default, the opacity is 100%, which means that
            it completely obscures any imagery beneath it. If you have changed the size and color

            <strong>Width</strong> - The default setting for line width is 1 pixel. You can adjust
            the thickness of the line from 0 to 4 pixels by clicking on the <em>Width</em> button
            and using the up and down arrows to adjust the width within the allowed range. You can

          You can change altitude settings in the Altitude tab of the Edit Placemark/Folder dialog
          box (<em>Edit &gt; Properties</em>). Altitude values can be set on a single item, across
          all items in a folder using shared styles, or using a mixture of altitude settings for
          items in a folder. Unlike other shared elements, modifying one item in a folder does not
          disable the shared style feature for other elements such as color and scale. If your
          folder contains items with different altitude settings, the parent folder indicates
          <em>Mixed Modes</em> as the altitude settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, you can use the values set in the <em>Altitude</em> area to extrude geometry.

        <h3>
          <a id="altitudesettings" name="altitudesettings"></a>Altitude Settings
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are three options for altitude:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Clamped to ground</strong> - By default, all folders and placemarks are set to
            this option. Here, because the altitude for the placemark is locked to the ground, no
            height value is allowed for altitude. This ensures that the placemark remains fixed to
            the earth, regardless of whether terrain is on or off.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relative to ground</strong> - When this option is selected, altitude of the
            placemark is relative to the actual ground elevation of the view. For example, if you
            set 9 meters as the altitude of a placemark in Venice, Italy, the elevation of the
            placemark will be 9 meters above the ground because Venice is at sea level. However, if
            you set the same placemark above Denver, Colorado, the elevation of the placemark will
            be 1616 meters, because the elevation of Denver is 1607 meters. You can see this how
            this appears in the 3D viewer by setting elevation, tilting the view, and turning
            terrain on and off.<br>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Absolute</strong> - When this option is selected, altitude of the Placemark is
            above sea level. In the example above, if you have terrain on and keep altitude to 9
            meters but set the altitude type to <em>Absolute</em>, the icon would disappear from
            view because it is actually below the level of the terrain at Denver, Colorado. You can
            adjust the altitude using the slider or by entering a value in meters in the

        </h2>
        <p>
          Applying description, label, and advanced settings to a folder provides display
          characteristics that differ from settings applied to individual placemarks or other
          geometry features. These differences are described here. For more information on how to
          apply these settings, see the rest of the topics in this section.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Folder name and description</strong> - The name and description that you
            provide when you edit a folder applies only to that folder and not to the items it
            contains. Use these fields to identify the folder and describe its contents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Folder view</strong> - As with the name and description, the view applies
            <em>only to the folder</em>. Setting a view for a folder is useful when you want to
            create a viewing angle to encompass all the items contained by the folder. For example,
            you might have a folder containing placemarks of your favorite golf clubs in a specific
            region, each with a separate viewing angle. You can place them all in a folder and set
            a viewing angle for the folder in order to display all of the placemarks from a
            consistent viewing angle, if desired. See <a href="#setview">Setting the View</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared styles</strong> - You can define a single style for a folder and have
            the style elements apply to all folder items when you want them to have the same line,
            label, and icon appearance. This is accomplished first by enabling the "sharing" state
            for the folder, if it is not already available.<br>
            <br>
            By default, when all items in a folder have either the exact same styles (same line,
            label, and icon settings) or <em>no</em> styles set, sharing is enabled for the parent
            folder. This means that setting universal styles for all folder items is simply a
            matter of setting the style for the parent folder.<br>
            <br>
            If the individual items within the folder have different style settings, sharing is
            turned off for the parent folder.<br>
            <br>
            You can click the <em>Share Style</em> button to enable style sharing for all items.
            Subsequent changes to the settings in this panel <em><strong>over-write</strong></em>
            any style modifications you have made to individual items within the folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared altitude settings</strong> - As with styles, altitude settings can apply
            to all items in the folder once style sharing is enabled (see above). This includes
            subfolders. Altitude settings apply to all geometry within the folder. However, if you
            set different altitude options for individual items within a folder, the altitude
            option for the folder indicates a setting of "mixed modes."

          with individual placemark modifications is to first apply shared settings to the folder
          to establish all desired common elements (e.g., icon scale and line color). At that
          point, you can modify individual items without affecting the general style settings for
          the other items. However, should you later re-enable shared styles, any individual
          modifications are overwritten.
