          Using Image Overlays and 3D Models
        </h2>
        <p>
          With Google Earth, you can place custom images and Google SketchUp 3D models over the
          view of the earth. Image overlays provide additional information about the underlying
          earth imagery. For example, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use a map of satellite weather data</strong> that updates to reflect the most
            recent weather imagery for that region.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use imagery of a site plan and parcel boundaries</strong> to view the
            development stages over a particular parcel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use publicly available image maps</strong> (or create your own image maps) for
            such things as hiking trails, camping spots, theme parks, fishing locations, national
            park boundaries, and more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google SketchUp is software that allows users to create 3D models and share them with
          others. For more information about Google SketchUp, <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"

          When you create an image overlay, you are specifying three important things:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What image file to display</strong> in the 3D viewer (from your computer, from
            your network, or from a website)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How to fit or position the image boundaries</strong> to the earth data beneath
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What the location and view</strong> of the imagery overlay is (in the same way
            you do when positioning a new placemark)

          <strong>Tip</strong> - You can hide an existing image overlay by unchecking it the
          <em>Places</em> panel. To permanently delete an image overlay, right-click on it in the
          <em>Places</em> panel and choose <em>Delete</em>. <a href="ug_editing.html">Learn more

        <h2>
          <a id="requirements" name="requirements"></a>Overlay Requirements
        </h2>
        <p>
          Overlay images can be taken from your computer, from your network, or from a web site.
          The image format must be one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>BMP
          </li>
          <li>DDS
          </li>
          <li>GIF
          </li>
          <li>JPG
          </li>
          <li>PGM
          </li>
          <li>PNG
          </li>
          <li>PPM
          </li>
          <li>TGA
          </li>
          <li>TIFF
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overlays in PNG and GIF formats can be modified so that undesirable regions (such as
          image boundaries) are transparent, letting the underlying imagery show through.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use topographical maps, weather satellite image maps, or other geographical image
          data as overlays. For ideas and examples of overlays, see the Google Earth Community
          bulletin board (<a href="http://bbs.keyhole.com">bbs.keyhole.com</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The overlay image itself must have a North-Top orientation with simple cylindrical
          projection. Simple cylindrical projection (or Plate Carr&eacute;e) is a simple map
          projection where the meridians and parallels are equidistant, straight parallel lines,
          with the two sets crossing at right angles. (This format is also known as Lat/Lon WGS84
          projection.) Because a certain amount of modifications to overlay images is allowed, you
          might find that the more common UTM maps work well enough over small areas. However, for
          a more precise overlay of a large region, simple cylindrical projection is required.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - The overlay feature is memory intensive. Consequently, images
          larger than 2000x2000 pixels can reduce the performance of Google Earth and other
          applications currently running on your computer. (To determine the size in pixels of an
          image, display the image file in a Windows Explorer window, right-click (CTRL click on
          the Mac) on it, and select <em>Properties</em> from the pop-up menu.) If you are having
          trouble importing a large image, you can reduce its size using image editing software
          such as Adobe Photoshop.
        </div>
        <h2>
          <a id="features" name="features"></a>Overlay Features
        </h2>
        <p>
          Once you create an overlay, it has many of the same features available to it as a simple
          placemark. With overlays, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Email them to other people</strong> - You can email image overlays just as you
            would mail other placemark data. However, keep in mind that overlay files can only be
            opened by other users of Google Earth. If you want to send the overlay image as it
            appears on the earth to someone who doesn't have Google Earth, email the view instead.
            For details on emailing overlays, see <a href=
            "ug_sharingplacedata.html#emailplace">Emailing Places Data</a>.<br>
            <br>
            When you email an overlay that references a local image, that image is automatically
            included with the overlay. You do not need to include the local image in your email
            attachment. This is an upgrade from Google Earth (Keyhole) version 2.2 and earlier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Save them to your computer.</strong> See <a href="ug_places.html#saving">Saving
            Places Data</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edit their properties and settings</strong> - See <a href=
            "ug_editing.html">Editing Places and Folders</a> for relevant information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to common placemark features, image overlays also have the following
          features:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Transparency Adjustment</strong> - You can adjust the transparency of an overlay
          from completely transparent to fully opaque whenever it is selected in the viewer. By
          adjusting the transparency of the overlay image, you can see how the overlay image
          corresponds to the 3D viewer imagery beneath.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="Transparency Adjustment" border="0" height="186" src="images/overlay.png"
          width="309">

        <ol>
          <li>Overview slider for selected overlay
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - You can also adjust the transparency of a selected overlay if
          your mouse has a scroll wheel. Click the slider (see above). Scroll down to make the
          overlay more opaque. Scroll up to make the overlay more transparent, .
        </div>
        <h3>
          <a id="terrain" name="terrain"></a>Terrain Integration
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you create an overlay, it completely integrates with the terrain or shape of the
          land beneath if the terrain layer is turned on. For example, you might create an overlay
          of Yosemite National Park and be able to view the trails in relationship to the 3D view
          of the mountains. In this way, the combination of an overlay map and the 3D viewer
          imagery gives more information than either one by itself.<br>

            <strong>Updates based on time or view coordinates</strong> - If you are viewing
            time-sensitive imagery that changes periodically, you can set the imagery to a refresh
            rate to make sure you are viewing the latest image. This is useful for viewing imagery
            maps from the web where the image is automatically updated.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, you can set the imagery to update depending upon your view. For example,
            you might be viewing imagery from a server that only delivers imagery that can be seen
            in your current 3D view. In this case, the imagery update changes whenever you navigate
            the 3D viewer to a new position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Draw Order</strong> - You can determine the hierarchy Google Earth uses when
            you use overlapping image overlays. Google Earth displays images with a higher draw
            order number in front of images with a lower draw number.

          image file.<br>
            <br>
            Try to position the viewer so that it corresponds in viewing altitude to the overlay.
            If the overlay is of a detailed view, <a href="index.html#fivethings">zoom into the
            subject area</a> so that you don't have to make large adjustments later. By contrast,
            if the overlay covers a large area, make sure the entire area is encompassed in the 3D
            viewer with some margins for adjusting the imagery.
          </li>
          <li value="2">Click <em>Add</em> &gt; <em>Image Overlay</em> or click <img alt=

            by right-clicking on the image on its web page and selecting <em>Copy Shortcut</em>
            from the pop-up menu. At that point, you can insert your cursor in the <em>Image
            URL</em> or <em>Filename</em> field and paste the information using Ctrl+V (<img alt=

            The image appears in the 3D viewer, with anchor points that you use to position it.
          </li>
          <li value="5">Specify the descriptive information for the overlay. Descriptions for
          overlays are identical to descriptions for all places data. See <a href=

          </li>
          <li value="6">Click the Refresh tab and set the correct refresh properties for your
          overlay imagery. The refresh settings for overlays are identical to those described for
          network links. Typically, any imagery that is updated automatically and located on a
          server will need refresh properties set. For example, weather satellite image maps will
          likely need to be refreshed. For details on the differences between time-based and
          view-based refresh, see the <a href="ug_sharingplacedata.html#networklinks">description
          for network links</a>.
          </li>
          <li value="7">Set the default transparency for the imagery using the slider. The
          transparency setting for image overlays can be adjusted at any time when you are viewing
          an overlay. To make it easy to position the overlay, first adjust the transparency to
          achieve a good balance between seeing the imagery and the earth beneath it.
          </li>
          <li value="8">When you select the View tab, you can modify the view settings for the
          overlay just as you would any place data. See <a href="ug_editing.html#setview">Setting
          the View</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li value="9">Position the image in the viewer to your preferences and click OK to
          complete the creation. If you later want to correct the overlay or reposition it, simply
          edit the overlay as you would any other places data. See the topics in <a href=
          "ug_editing.html">Editing Places and Folders</a> for more information.

        <h4>
          <a id="positioning" name="positioning"></a>Positioning the Imagery in the Viewer
        </h4>
        <p>
          Once you have inserted the overlay image into the viewer, you can use the green markers
          to stretch and move the image in a number of ways to get the most exact positioning
          required. An overlay image will have corner and edge marks that you can use to stretch
          the image, a central cross hair marker to position the image, and a triangle marker that
          you can use to rotate the image.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you select one of these markers, the cursor changes from an open hand to either a
          finger-pointing hand or an arrow to indicate that an anchor point is selected. The
          following illustration describes the anchor points in detail.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="Positioning the Overlay in the Viewer" border="0" height="306" src=
          "images/overlay-position.jpg" width="405">
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use the center cross-hair marker to slide the entire overlay on the globe and
          position it from the center. (Tip: do this first.)
          </li>
          <li>Use the triangle marker to rotate the image for better placement.
          </li>
          <li>Use any of the corner cross-hair markers to stretch or skew the selected corner. If
          you press the Shift key when selecting this marker, the image is scaled from the center.
          </li>
          <li>Use any of the four side anchors to stretch the image in or out of from the selected
          side. If you press the Shift key when doing this, the image is scaled from the center.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Tip</strong> - Try positioning the center of the image as a reference point
          first, and then use the <em>Shift</em> key in combination with one of the anchors to
          scale the image for best positioning.
        </div>
        <h4>
          <a id="advancedsettings" name="advancedsettings"></a>Position settings
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you select the <em>Location</em> tab, you can use the following settings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Manual coordinates for each corner of the image overlay.</strong> This is
            similar in principle to the manual setting discussed in <a href=
            "ug_editing.html#respositioning">Repositioning Placemarks</a>, except that instead of
            setting coordinates for a single point, you set coordinates for each corner of the
            image overlay. You might want to use this feature if your image overlay comes from a
            precise map where the exact coordinates are known.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Draw Order</strong> - If you have more than one overlay for a given region, you
            can set the draw order for overlays to determine which image is displayed relative to
            other images. Overlays with higher numbers are drawn before those with lower numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fit to Screen</strong> - Click this to resize the image to fit the current
            view.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you select the View tab, you can modify the view settings for the overlay just as
          you would any place data. See <a href="ug_editing.html#setview">Setting the View</a> for
          details.
