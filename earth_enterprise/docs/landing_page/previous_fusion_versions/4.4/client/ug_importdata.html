        <h2>
          Importing Your Data Into Google Earth
        </h2>
        <p>
          Use the Data Import feature to import your custom geographic data into Google Earth and
          view it as you would any of the <a href="ug_layers.html">layers</a> in the Layers panel.
          When you use this import feature, you are importing two basic kinds of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Vector Data</strong> - Vector data consists of points, lines, paths, and
            polygons. Typically, point data is used to describe specific locations, such as the
            center of a city. Lines and paths can be used for road or boundary data, for example,
            while polygons might be used to describe parcel data or define other areas such as
            lakes. You can import vector data into Google Earth from third-party data providers,
            such as ESRI. In addition, you can use generic text files to import point data that you
            define yourself. Once you import vector data into the Google Earth application, you can
            change its appearance or content in the same way you would when editing placemarks and
            folders. In addition, you can use <em>Style Templates</em> to format your data in
            visually meaningful ways. You can also display <a href="ug_kml.html">KML data</a> in a
            time sequence. To learn more, see <a href="ug_gps.html#timeline">Viewing a
            Timeline</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Imagery Data</strong> - You can import imagery data such as aerial maps or
            topographical maps and have the imagery properly projected over the base imagery in the
            3D viewer. For this to work, the imagery file itself must be in the proper format.
            Imagery of this type is referred to as <em>GIS imagery</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>ï¿½
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Import features are available only to Google Earth Pro and EC
          users.
        </div>
        <p>
          Once you import vector or imagery data into the Google Earth application, you can save
          your modified data just as you would other types of placemarks or overlays.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a id="importvector" name="importvector"></a>Importing Vector Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          Google Earth Pro and EC support the following kinds of vector data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Points
          </li>
          <li>Lines and paths
          </li>
          <li>Polygons, including filled polygons
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The process of importing vector data files is simple:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Import the vector file using one of the following ways:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Drag and drop</strong> - Locate the file on your computer or a network
                server and drag it over the Google Earth 3D viewer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Select <em>Open</em> or <em>Import...</em> from the <em>File</em>
                menu</strong> - When you choose this option, you can specifically select the type
                of data you're importing (i.e., TXT, SHP, TAB) or indicate <em>All data import
                formats</em> from the select menu.
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            You can also open a file from a machine on the network as you would open any file. In
            addition, if you want to open a file located on a web browser, you must first download
            the file <em>and all related files</em> to your computer or local network and then open
            it.
          </li>
          <li>At the prompt, choose whether or not to apply a style template. If you select Yes to
          apply a style template, you can define a new one at that point, or select an existing one
          if one has already been defined for that data file. For more information, see <a href=
          "ug_styles.html">Using Style Templates</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Once imported, the vector elements appear in the 3D viewer and the imported file is
          listed under the <em>Temporary Places</em> folder. Labels, icons, color, and description
          appear just as they do for other types of places and folders depending upon how you have
          defined them using the style template.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> If you don't use a style template to modify the appearance of the
          data you've ingested, Google Earth looks for a <em class="c4">Name</em> field to use as
          the label for your data. This label appears in the 3D viewer next to points as well as in
          the listing beneath <em>Temporary Places</em>. If your data does not contain a
          <em>Name</em> field, the first available field that contains text is used as the label
          for data.

        <p>
          Google Earth EC and Google Earth PRO users with the data import module can import the
          following vector file formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>MapInfo (TAB) - Required files include:
            <ul>
              <li>MAP ID
              </li>
              <li>DAT
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>ESRI Shape (SHP) - Requires SHX Projection information, which can either be built
          into the SHP file or defined in a separate file with a PRJ extension DBF (for viewing
          field data)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most third-party GIS vector data comes as a collection of related files that operate
          together to produce all the vector data you see in Google Earth. Be aware that if
          expected data does not display in the 3D viewer, it might be due to missing support
          files. Those vector file types that require additional support files are indicated in the
          list above.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - You can also use generic text files to create your own point data
          for use in Google Earth.

          <a id="text" name="text"></a>Using Generic Text Files
        </h2>
        <p>
          In addition to importing vector data in SHP, TAB, and other formats, you can define your
          own point data and import it into Google Earth.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Only point data can be created and imported using generic text
          files.
        </div>
        <p>
          Generic text files need named columns whose values are separated either by commas,
          spaces, or tabs. Do this by creating your data in a spreadsheet application such as
          Microsoft Excel and then saving the file as either CSV or TXT format. Alternatively, you
          could use a programmatic method to extract data from a database and produce a final
          output file in either CSV or TXT format.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - If you attempt to import more than 5000 features (i.e., 5000
          point data lines) into Google Earth, this process can take a long time.

          At minimum, generic text file that you import must contain one or more fields that
          specify the <em>location of the point</em> on the earth in order for the data to be
          correctly positioned in the 3D viewer. This can be specified either with address fields
          or with geographic coordinates.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - You cannot use a mix of geographic coordinates and address fields

        </h2>
        <p class="note">
          <strong>Tip</strong>: Follow a tutorial on this subject: <a href=
          "http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/tutorials/import.html" target="_blank">Importing
          Addresses in Google Earth Pro and EC</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your data file can use street-level addressing to position each point on the Earth's
          surface. Google Earth can ingest georeferenced and non-georeferenced information. At this
          time, Google Earth can only ingest such information for addresses located within the
          United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. Google Earth
          cannot place any address that contains a P.O. box.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following types of address formatting are supported:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-address field</strong> - You can define the street, city, state,
            country, and zip code in a single field. For example, a single field with the column
            label of <em>address</em> might have the following value:<br>
            <br>
            123 Easy Street, San Jose, CA, 95330 <strong>Multiple address fields</strong> - You can
            also define street, city, state, country, and zip code in multiple fields. In this
            case, a field with a column label of <em>street</em> would have as its value:<br>
            <br>
            123 Easy Street<br>
            <br>
            In this scenario, additional fields would be defined for city, state, and zip code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Partial address default values</strong> - Because some of your points might
            have only partial addresses, you can use the data import wizard to define default
            values for missing fields, such as state or zip Code.
          </li>

        <p>
          You can use geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) to indicate the position of the

        <h3>
          <a id="optfields" name="optfields"></a>Optional and Descriptive Fields
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can use any number of fields in your custom data file to label and describe the
          points and display them the Google Earth application. Optional fields can be defined as
          the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text or strings - A string field can contain both numbers and alphabetic characters.
          What actually defines a string with respect to style templates is that the string itself
          is either enclosed in quotation marks, or contains white space so that it cannot be
          interpreted as a number.<br>
            <br>
            This is an important distinction to keep in mind when using style templates applied to
            fields.
          </li>
          <li>Integer
          </li>
          <li>Floating point value
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With style templates, you can take advantage of these field types to create useful visual
          effects in the 3D viewer such as graphs or color-coding of data based on the values in
          the fields.

          After you have imported vector data into Google Earth, you can use the <em>Table
          Window</em> to display the data fields contained within the vector data. To do this,
          select <em>Table</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu. The window appears over the Google
          Earth application, listing the data fields of all placemark items in tabular form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Table</em> window displays internal data fields for all vector data currently
          listed as well as all other entries in the <em>Places</em> panel. You can use the scroll
          bar to the right of the window to scroll through numerous entries, and you can collapse
          the display of items you don't want to see by removing the check next to the name of the
          item you want to minimize.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can open GIS imagery files in Google Earth Pro or EC and have the files correctly
          projected over the proper map coordinates in the 3D viewer. Google Earth Pro and EC
          support the following types of GIS imagery:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>TIFF (.tif), including GeoTiff and compressed TIFF files
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Select <em>Open</em> from the <em>File</em> menu.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google Earth then attempts to reproject the image to a Simple Cylindrical, WGS84
          coordinate system. From this, it creates an overlay with the image converted to PNG
          format. The overlay edit window appears, and you can set the location of the new overlay
          in any folder inside the <em>Places</em> panel. You can also set the properties for the
          GIS imagery as you would any other overlay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following should be noted when importing GIS imagery data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The reprojected image is saved as an overlay</strong>. The image is saved under
            the Google Earth directory on your hard drive. The name of the PNG file is based on the
            source file name and the scaling or cropping parameters selected when importing the
            overlay. (See below for more information on scaling or cropping an image.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Images that exceed the maximum texture dimensions must be either cropped or
            scaled</strong>. A dimension of 2048x2048 pixels is typically supported by high-end
            graphics cards, while on laptop computers, the maximum dimension can be 1024x1024 or
            even less. (Very good cards can support up to 4096x4096.)<br>
            <br>
            Determine the maximum allowable texture dimensions for your computer by clicking Help
            &gt; <em>About Google Earth</em>:<br>

            Your image cannot exceed the Max Texture dimension listed. If you try to import an
            image file that exceeds the allowable texture dimensions, a dialog box prompts you to
            either scale or crop the image.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Scale</strong> - This option scales and reprojects the entire image at the
                same time so that it preserves the aspect ratio of the input image and fits the
                results in texture memory. The typical size for the resultant image is 2048 pixels
                along the longest side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Crop</strong> - This option preserves the original resolution of the input
                image while creating a subset of the original input file in order to fit it in
                texture memory.
              </li>
            </ul>When you select the crop option, the viewer flies to the location of the input
            image and contains the extents of the input image. You then select the center point of
            the inset image you want to create. The client computes a maximum area centered from
            the selected location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For larger image files, reprojection can take some time.</strong><br>
            <br>
            If you have cropped or scaled an input image, or if you are reprojecting an image that
            uses more texture memory, you will see a progress meter while the reprojection occurs.
            You can cancel the operation at any time. <strong>Images that contain no projection
            information are treated as ordinary overlay files.</strong><br>
            <br>
            In this case, you can position the image manually as you would an overlay image.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Images that contain incorrect or unsupported projection information will not be
            imported.</strong><br>

          Typically, the data you import into the Google Earth application is created with a
          specific geographic coordinate system, such as a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
          projection and a NAD27 datum (North American Datum of 1927). Each geographic coordinate
          system may assign slightly different coordinates to the same location on the earth. When
          you import data into Google Earth, your data is interpreted according to the Google Earth
          coordinate system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the majority of cases, reprojection works as expected. In some situations, the
          transformation might not work properly. In that case, you can use a third-party tool to
          transform your data from its original coordinate system into the one used by Google
          Earth.

        <h2>
          <a id="mapprojection" name="mapprojection"></a>What is a Map Projection?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A map projection is a mathematical expression that is used to represent the round, 3D
          surface of the earth on a flat, 2D map.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt=
          "A map projection is a mathematical expression that is used to represent the round, 3-dimensional surface of the earth on a flat, 2-dimensional map"

          <li>3D Earth
          </li>
          <li>Mercator Projection
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This process <em>always results in distortion</em> to one or more map properties, such as
          area, scale, shape, or direction. Because of this, hundreds of projections have been
          developed in order to accurately represent a <em>particular</em> map element or to best
          suit a particular type of map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data sources for maps come in various projections depending upon which characteristic the
          cartographer chooses to represent more accurately (at the expense of other
          characteristics). In the example above, the Mercator projection preserves the right
          angles of the latitude and longitudinal lines at the expense of area, which is distorted
          at the poles, showing the land masses there to be larger than they actually are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following are some common map projections:

              Typically used for small regions or countries extending in an east-to-west direction,
              but not continents. Preserves angles between meridians and parallels. Attempts to
              minimize distortion for both shape and linear scale, but neither is truly correct.
              The example here shows how this projection looks over the entire earth.

              A cylindrical projection like the Mercator projections, but where the cylinder is
              shifted to align with a region that is oblique and follows neither a north-south nor
              an east-west axis. The region to be mapped typically is a small portion along the
              length of the meridian and close to it laterally. For example, this projection was
              developed originally for mapping the Malaysian peninsula.

          When building whole-earth databases, a single global projection is the most convenient to
          use. Google Earth uses Simple Cylindrical projection for its imagery base. This is a
          simple map projection where the meridians and parallels are equidistant, straight lines,
          with the two sets crossing at right angles. This projection is also known as Lat/Lon
          WGS84.<br>

        </h2>
        <p>
          While a projection is used in mapping to define the earth on a flat surface, a datum is
          used to describe the actual shape of the earth in mathematical terms. This is because the
          earth's surface is not perfectly round, but ellipsoid in shape. A datum also defines the
          association of latitude and longitude coordinates to points on the surface of the earth,
          and defines the basis for elevation measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with projections, there is more than one mathematical interpretation of the earth's
          shape. Google Earth uses WGS84 datum.
