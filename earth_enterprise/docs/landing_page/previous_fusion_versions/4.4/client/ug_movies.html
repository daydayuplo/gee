          Making Movies with Google Earth
        </h2>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Movie making features are available to users of the Google Earth
          Pro and Google Earth EC products. <a href="http://earth.google.com/products.html">Learn
          more</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          You can use the Movie Maker feature of Google Earth to record 3D viewer imagery and save
          the recording as a movie file. You can either set the recorder to record your
          interactions with the 3D viewer in real-time, or you can set up a tour and record the
          entire tour without interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you finish recording and have saved your file, you can make the file available on a
          web site, use it in a presentation, or send it via email. For instance, you might want to
          create a movie of your property to present to clients or at trade shows where visitors
          can see satellite views of your property without having to use Google Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a id="formats" name="formats"></a>The Movie Maker feature supports different movie file
          formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Windows Media Video (WMV)</strong> - (Windows and Linux only) This output file
            format is compressed and optimized for presentations. These WMV files can be further
            configured for the best type of delivery, such as via a T1 web connection or over a 56K
            modem connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Audio Video Interleave (AVI)</strong> - (Windows and Linux only) Movies created
            in AVI format are uncompressed and as a result, generate extremely large files, making
            it almost impossible for a standard movie player to play back the recording. This is
            useful only if you want to edit the movie clips using a movie editing software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image Stream (JPG)</strong> - Movies can be captured as images in variable or
            fixed length. This format is useful if you want to control the speed artificially and
            edit each screenshot (frame by frame).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>QuickTime</strong> - (Mac only) Movies can be captured in Apple QuickTime .mov
            format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          <a id="quality" name="quality"></a>Movie Quality Levels
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Movie Maker feature also supports two types of movie quality levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Standard quality movie (real-time)</strong> - Use this option when you want to
            adjust the visibility of icons and overlays while the movie is recording. For example,
            use this option to display an overlay of a site plan or additional layers of
            information as you record. Keep in mind that with this option, the frame rate is
            limited to the performance of your graphics card, which is generally slowed by making
            movies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High-quality movie (tour-mode only)</strong> - In general, high quality
            recordings work best when you want to display the movie on a large screen. Use this
            option to achieve the best possible movie recording. With this option, each frame is
            completely downloaded to the Google Earth client before it is recorded, maximizing
            image quality. For this reason, recording time is comparatively slow. Unlike the
            standard quality movie, you do not need to monitor the actual recording of the movie.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Keep in mind that high quality movies can only play back tour
          points. You cannot manually interact with the 3D viewer when using the high quality
          option.
        </div>
        <h2>
          <a id="tips" name="tips"></a>Tips for Recording Movies
        </h2>
        <p>
          This section covers a number of tips to help you create quality movies. We recommend you
          familiarize yourself with these tips before beginning your recording in order to produce
          the best possible movie for your needs.

          <a id="updateplayer" name="updateplayer"></a>Update Your Movie Player
        </h3>
        <p>
          Having the latest version of Windows Media Player or Apple QuickTime installed is
          absolutely essential to making good quality movies, especially if you are having issues
          with the graphics quality of your movie. We highly recommend that you download Windows
          Media Player 9 or above:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/9series/default.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/9series/default.aspx</a>

        <h3>
          <a id="updatedriver" name="updatedriver"></a>Update Your Graphics Card Driver
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although graphics card drivers have no impact on the actual <em>recording</em> of your
          movie, a faulty graphics card driver can produce anomalies in your 3D viewer that then
          transfer into the movie itself. Therefore, it's always good practice to update your
          driver to avoid any possible rendering issues. We recommend that you use a graphics card
          with at least 64 MB of video RAM or above.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="increasecache" name="increasecache"></a>Increase Your Memory Cache
        </h3>
        <p>
          By increasing your memory cache size, your movie recording experience will go faster
          (although it will have no impact on the final quality of your movie). To increase your
          memory cache, see <a href="ug_3dviewer.html#memory">Memory and Disk Cache
          Preferences</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a id="increasearea" name="increasearea"></a>Increase the Detail Area of the 3D Viewer
        </h3>
        <p>
          Increasing the area of detail for your 3D viewer helps to capture all the pixels in more
          detail. As a result, the resolution of your movie is improved. See <a href=
          "ug_3dviewer.html#viewprefs">Viewing Preferences</a> for instructions.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Set <em>Detail Area</em> to <em>Large</em> if you have 64 MB of
          graphics card memory or more. If you have less than 64 MB of graphics card memory, set
          <em>Detail Area</em> to <em>Medium</em>.
        </div>
        <h3>
          <a id="adjustspeed" name="adjustspeed"></a>Adjust the Touring Speed
        </h3>
        <p>
          When recording, it is best to use a relatively slow tour speed. However, feel free to
          experiment with different speeds and then play the movie back to evaluate whether the
          speed is appropriate. See <a href="ug_touringplaces.html">Using Tours</a> for details.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - The tour speed you choose will be consistent throughout the
          movie. If you want to set different tour speeds for different Placemarks in the same
          movie, you will need to create separate movie files for each tour and then edit them in a
          movie making software.

          It's a good idea to set up and review the tour points you want to visit in your movie.
          This involves two simple actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the <em>Places</em> panel, select either an entire folder to view all the
          placemarks within it, or select individual items in the folder to view only selected
          ones. See <a href="ug_touringplaces.html">Using Tours</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li>Click the <em>Play</em> button that appears below the <em>Places</em> panel to play
          the tour. This tour is the same tour that will be followed if you use the <em>High
          Quality Movie</em> option, so you can have a sense of what your movie will look like by
          playing the tour. See <a href="ug_touringplaces.html">Using Tours</a> for details.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After previewing your movie, be sure to make any adjustments necessary before recording.
          For example, if you want to change the view of a particular placemark on the tour, you
          can always right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on the placemark, then select <em>Snapshot
          View</em> in the menu. This will overwrite your existing placemark view. See <a href=
          "ug_editing.html">Editing Places and Folders</a> for more details.

        <p>
          Making movies is a memory-intensive and graphics-intensive process. It's best not to have
          multiple large applications running on your computer during recording. Disable both
          screen savers and pop-up blockers.

          <strong>Tip</strong> - <a href=
          "http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/tutorials/movies.html" target="_blank">Follow a
          tutorial on this subject</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          Follow these steps to record your movie:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>From the Tools menu, select <em>Movie Maker</em>. The Movie Maker dialog box appears.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From the <em>Supported Compression Formats</em> selector, choose the desired
            compression format for your movie.</strong><br>
            <br>
            If you want to have a movie format other than WMV (Windows Media Video) or .mov
            (QuickTime), check the <em>Advanced</em> checkbox and choose the format. If you choose
            another movie format, only standard AVI compression is available. Note that AVI formats
            are not compressed and therefore will result in large files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Select <em>High Quality</em> or <em>Standard Quality</em> as the movie
            quality.</strong> See <a href="#quality">Movie Quality Levels</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose the Frames Per Second (FPS) you desire for your movie.</strong> The
            highest FPS setting, <em>60</em>, offers the smoothest movie viewing experience, but at
            the cost of a large file size. For instance, if you want to record a 800 x 600 movie at
            60 FPS, you will not achieve the best results. In this case, choose a lower setting in
            order to produce a smaller file. The lower the FPS setting, the more jerky the movie
            will be. You'll want to find the best compromise between frame transition and file
            size. Typically, a setting of 30 works fairly well for movies that you want to provide
            over the Internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose the resolution for your movie.</strong> You'll want to choose a
            resolution that is appropriate for your final movie display. For example, you might
            have a computer screen projector that only supports a 800 x 600 format. You can specify
            the following resolutions, which indicate the width and height of the movie in pixels:
            <ul>
              <li>320 x 240
              </li>
              <li>640 x 480
              </li>
              <li>800 x 600
              </li>
              <li>720 x 480 (NTSC) - This setting works well with large screen displays.
              </li>
              <li>720 x 576 (PAL)
              </li>
              <li>1280x720 (HD)
              </li>
              <li>1920x1080 (HD)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specify a name for your movie.</strong> Click on the <em>Browse</em> button and
            navigate to a location on your computer where you want to save the movie file when you
            are finished recording. Type in a name for the file in the file dialog box and click on
            the OK button.<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, you can select an existing movie file in the same format as the one you
            are about to create, and that file will be overwritten with the contents of your new
            recording.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - If you are recording your movie as an image stream, it's best to
          choose a new filename or folder location rather than overwriting an existing image stream
          selection.
        </div>
        <ol start="7">
          <li>
            <strong>Click the <em>Record Tour</em> button.</strong> The button is available only
            after you enter a valid filename for your movie. When the movie begins recording, the
            Movie Maker dialog box appears below so you can visualize the recording of the movie.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Recording time in high quality movies occurs very slowly, since
          each frame is fully processed before the next one is viewed.

          When you are finished the <a href="#steps">steps of recording movies</a>, to stop
          recording, click the <em>Stop Recording</em> button in the Movie Maker dialog box. Once
          you finish recording your movie, you can open the movie file in a media player that
          supports the movie format you selected and play back the movie to view the results. If
          you are satisfied with the results, you can post the file to a local server or use it in
          a presentation.
