          Once you are familiar with the basics of marking places on the Earth, you can refer to
          this section to learn all the features available to you in the <em>Places</em> panel.
          This section includes the following topics:

        <h2>
          <a id="organizing" name="organizing"></a>Organizing Places Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can organize your saved data in the <em>Places</em> panel in a way similar to how you
          would organize files and folders on your computer's hard drive. This section covers the
          following:
        </p>

        </ul>
        <h3>
          <a id="creating" name="creating"></a>Creating Folders
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can create folders and move other folders, placemarks, or shapes to them. To create a
          folder:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Right-click on a folder in the Places panel.
          </li>
          <li>Select <em>Add &gt; Folder</em> from the pop-up menu. The folder you right-clicked on
          is automatically set as the container for the new folder.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Once the <em>New Folder</em> dialog box appears, you can set the following fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Description</strong> - Enter a description for the folder. For example, you
            might enter text that gives a general description of all the placemarks in the folder.
            The first few words of the description appear below the folder in the <em>Places</em>
            panel. When you double-click the folder, the description appears in a balloon in the 3D
            viewer. In addition, you can use a number of HTML tags to format your description and
            include images, including &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;img src="..."&gt;, and
            &lt;a href="..."&gt;. See <a href="ug_editing.html#writing">Writing Descriptions</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Style</strong><strong>/Color</strong> - Once you have other icons within the
            new folder (or its subfolders) the <em>Style/Color</em> tab is available. You can use
            this feature to apply label and icon styles universally across all items within the
            folder. See <a href="ug_editing.html">Editing Places and Folders</a> for more
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View</strong> - See <a href="ug_editing.html#setview">Setting the View</a> for
            details. Once you set a view for a folder, double-clicking on the folder repositions
            the 3D viewer to the position you have chosen. Setting a view for a folder is useful
            when you want to create a viewing angle to encompass all the items contained by the
            folder. For example, you might have a collection of placemarks in a specific region of
            the city, each with an independent viewing angle. You can place them all in a folder
            and set a viewing angle for the folder in order to display all of the placemarks from a
            consistent viewing angle, if desired.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <a id="reordering" name="reordering"></a>Reordering Placemarks or Folders
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can reposition a placemark or folder in three ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drag it to a new position in a list of items.
          </li>
          <li>Drag and drop it over a folder.
          </li>
          <li>Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) the item and select Cut from the pop-up menu,
          followed by right-clicking on the new position or folder and selecting Paste from the
          pop-up menu.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this way, you can put placemarks inside newly created folders, or you can move an
          entire folder and its contents into another folder to create groups of folders.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> If you move a folder so that it is inside the <em>Temporary
          Places</em> main folder, you must save that data if you want it to be available the next
          time you start Google Earth. If you exit Google Earth without saving the folder, a dialog
          box prompts you to save the information to your <em>My Places</em> folder. See <a href=
          "#saving">Saving Places Data</a> for details.

          <a id="renaming" name="renaming"></a>Renaming a Placemark or Folder
        </h3>
        <p>
          To quickly rename an item, right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on it and select
          <em>Rename</em> from the pop-up menu. You can enter the new name directly in the name
          field. You can also:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose <em>Rename</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu if the item is selected in the
          list
          </li>
          <li>(Windows and Linux only) Select the item and press <em>F2</em> on the keyboard
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <a id="removing" name="removing"></a>Removing a Placemark or Folder
        </h3>
        <p>
          To delete an item, right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) the entry and select
          <em>Delete</em> from the pop-up menu, or select <em>Delete</em> from the <em>Edit</em>
          menu when the item is selected in the <em>Places</em> panel. A confirmation dialog box
          asks if you want to delete the placemark or folder. If you delete a folder, you also
          delete all its contents, including other folders and icons. Click <em>Yes</em> to confirm
          the deletion.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a id="saving" name="saving"></a>Saving Places Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can save placemarks, shapes, and entire folders (and their contents) to your
          computer's hard drive. The placemark file or folder is saved as a single file in
          <em>KMZ</em> format, which you can open at any time in Google Earth. You might want to do
          this for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>You want to share the saved data with other Google Earth users.</strong> You
            can email any placemark, shape, or folder to another Google Earth user from within
            Google Earth, but you can also email any KMZ file located on your computer to a Google
            Earth user. In addition, you can post a KMZ file to the Google Earth BBS where other
            Google Earth users can view the information, or you can serve the file on your own web
            server or from any network location. See <a href="ug_sharingplacedata.html">Sharing
            Places Information</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You have so many places in your My Places folder that Google Earth startup is
            slow.</strong> Each time you start Google Earth, all the places data is processed
            during startup, even if it is not turned on in the 3D viewer. Holding a large amount of
            data in the <em>My Places</em> folder can impact the performance of Google Earth,
            depending upon your computer. By saving folders to your hard drive, you can improve
            Google Earth performance by then deleting the data from your My Places folder once they
            are saved to disk. You can always open the data you save at any time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Save individual placemarks, shapes, or entire folders by right-clicking (CTRL click on
          the Mac) the item and selecting <em>Save As...</em> from the pop-up menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the <em>File</em> dialog box to save the placemark or folder to your computer. Enter
          the name for the new file, and click <em>Save</em> in the dialog box. The placemark or
          the folder is saved to that location with an extension of <em>.kmz</em>.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Placemarks created with Google Earth version 3.0 or higher
          cannot be viewed in older Google Earth software. As an alternative, you can send an image

        <p>
          You can use the following methods to open placemarks and folders saved to the file system
          on your computer's hard drive.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the File menu, select Open. Navigate to the folder on your computer that
          contains the KMZ or KML data you want to open in Google Earth. Select the file and click
          the <em>Open</em> button. The folder or placemark appears beneath the <em>Temporary
          Places</em> folder and the 3D viewer flies to the view set for the folder or placemark
          (if any).

          <li>Locate the file you want to open. Once you have located the file on your computer,
          you can simply drag and drop the KMZ file over the <em>Places</em> panel or 3D viewer.
          The 3D viewer load the file and flies to the view set for the folder or placemark (if
          any).

          <strong>Tip:</strong> When you use the drag-and-drop method of opening a placemark or
          folder, you can drop the item over a specific folder in the <em>Places</em> panel. If the
          <em>My Places</em> folder is closed and you want to drop it there, just hold the item
          over the <em>My Places</em> folder until the folder opens up and you can place the item
          within subfolders or in the list. Items dropped in the <em>My Places</em> folder appear
          the next time you start Google Earth. Otherwise, you can drop the item in the
          <em>Temporary Places</em> folder. Items opened this way appear only for the current
          session of Google Earth unless you save them.

        </h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of ways you can remove data from the Places panel:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Delete</strong> - Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) a placemark, folder, or
            other item in the <em>Places</em> panel and select <em>Delete</em> from the pop-up
            menu. You can also delete items in the 3D viewer by right-clicking (CTRL click on the
            Mac) on the icon and selecting <em>Delete</em> from the pop-up menu. This deletes the
            item from the <em>Places</em> panel. If the item is located in your <em>Temporary
            Places</em> folder, it does not appear the next time you use Google Earth. If you have
            previously saved the item, you can always open the saved data at any time. Otherwise,
            the item is permanently removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delete Key</strong> - With the item selected in the <em>Places</em> panel,
            press the <em>Delete</em> key. A dialog box asks to confirm the deletion. Click
            <em>OK</em> to remove the item from the Places panel.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Delete Contents</strong> - Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) a folder and
                select <em>Delete Contents</em> from the pop-up menu. Click <em>Yes</em> on the
                confirmation dialog box to proceed with deleting the contents. All folder contents
                are removed, including any subfolders and contained items.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cut Contents (Ctrl-X)</strong> - Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) an
                item in the <em>Places</em> panel and select <em>Cut</em> from the pop-up menu, or
                right-click on a placemark in the 3D viewer and select <em>Cut</em> there. The item
                is removed from the listing or view, but copied to the clipboard, so that you can
                later paste it to a different location.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <a id="showhide" name="showhide"></a>Showing and Hiding Places Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          Once you begin collecting a fair amount of place data, you can use the show/hide features
          of Google Earth to quickly manage the amount of content visible in the 3D viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To hide places data, select or de-select the check box next to an item</strong>.
          To turn off the display for a single placemark or overlay in the 3D viewer, click the
          item to remove the check mark. To turn on a single item, select the check box. For entire
          folders, you can turn on all items in the folder by selecting the folder's check box if
          it is not already selected. In this case, all items in the folder are turned on. A
          subsequent click turns off all items in the folder.
