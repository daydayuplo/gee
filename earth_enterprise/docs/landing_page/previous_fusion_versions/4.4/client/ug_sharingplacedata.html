        <h2>
          Emailing an Image
        </h2>
        <p>
          At this time, emailing a Google Earth image on the Mac is available only through the
          Mail, Entourage and Eudora applications. You can email the current view of the earth
          shown in the Google Earth 3D viewer as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An image file for people who don't have Google Earth
          </li>
          <li>A KMZ file for other users of Google Earth
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you email an image, a JPEG file is automatically attached to an outbound email
          message. When you email the view as a KMZ, a KMZ file is automatically attached to an
          outbound email message. To email an image:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do one of the following:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Email</em> &gt; <em>Email Image</em>.
          </li>
          <li>Type Ctrl+Alt+E (Windows and Linux only)
          </li>
          <li>Click on the email icon <img alt="Email icon" height="22" src=
          "images/email_button.png" width="29">on the toolbar and choose <em>Email Image</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>In the <em>Select Email Service</em> window, choose your default email program or
          your Gmail account. If you use your Gmail account, you will be prompted to sign in if you
          have not already.<br>
            <br>
            Before selecting your email service, select the <em>Remember this setting...</em> check
            box if you want to use the same email service every time you email a view. You can
            always change your email preferences later by selecting <em>Tools</em> &gt;
            <em>Options</em> &gt; <em>General</em> (Windows/Linux) or <em>Google Earth</em> &gt;
            <em>Preferences</em> (Mac) and clicking on the <em>General</em> tab.
          </li>
          <li>Wait while the Google Earth software sends the data to your email application. A new
          email window appears with the image file. (This can take a few seconds.) The image is a
          JPG file of the current view in the 3D viewer.
          </li>
          <li>Fill in the recipient's email address and any other information in the body and send
          the email.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When you email an image, the quality of that image is identical to the quality available
          for the Save Image feature in Google Earth.

          Emailing Places Data

        <p>
          In addition to emailing a <em>view</em> as a KMZ file to other users of Google Earth, you
          also can email places data in two other ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attach a KMZ file or folder saved to your computer's hard drive to an email. If you
          followed the instructions listed in <a href="ug_places.html#saving">Saving Places
          Data</a>, locate your saved KMZ file and attach it to an outbound email as you would with
          any attachment.
          </li>
          <li>Email a placemark that is centered in your 3D viewer directly from Google Earth (see
          below).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To email places data:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do one of the following:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Email</em> &gt; <em>Email Place</em> .
          </li>
          <li>Type Ctrl + E (<img alt="Command/Open Apple Key" border="0" class="c3" height="14"
          src="images/mac-cmdkey.gif" width="14">+ E on the Mac)
          </li>
          <li>Click on the email icon <img alt="Email icon" height="22" src=
          "images/email_button.png" width="29">on the toolbar and choose <em>Email Place</em>.
          </li>
          <li>Right click (CTRL click on the Mac) the appropriate placemark in the Places panel and
          choose <em>Email</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>In the <em>Select Email Service</em> window, choose your default email program or
          your Gmail account. If you use your Gmail account, you will be prompted to sign in if you
          have not already.<br>
            <br>
            Before selecting your email service, select the <em>Remember this setting...</em> check
            box if you want to use the same email service every time you email a view. You can
            always change your email preferences later by selecting <em>Tools</em> &gt;
            <em>Options</em> &gt; <em>General</em> (Windows/Linux) or <em>Google Earth</em> &gt;
            <em>Preferences</em> (Mac) and clicking on the <em>General</em> tab. Wait while the
            Google Earth software sends the data to your email application. A new email window
            appears with the KMZ file. (This can take a few seconds.)
          </li>
          <li>Fill in the recipient's email address and any other information in the body and send
          the email.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Things to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you email KMZ files that reference custom icons or image overlays from your
          local file system those items are included with the placemark data. For this reason, KMZ
          files that include imagery overlays might be larger than those containing a simple
          placemark.
          </li>
          <li>If you are sending a placemark file to a user of a Google Earth (Keyhole) client
          version 2.2 or lower, the recipient will not be able to view the placemark. The file
          format for placemarks has changed for Google Earth versions 3.0 and higher. Send an image
          file instead.
          </li>

        <p>
          If your email application does not respond to the <em>Email View</em> command, you may
          need to set the default email program. To do this in Windows, open the <em>Control
          Panel</em> from the Start menu and select <em>Internet Options</em>. Click the
          <em>Programs</em> tab, select the default email program that you use from the
          <em>E-mail</em> drop-down list, and click <em>Apply</em>. You should now be able to send
          a view with your email application. To do this on a Mac, open Mail. Click Mail &gt;
          Preferences. Pick the email application you'd prefer as your default email handler.

        <h2>
          Sharing Data Over a Network
        </h2>
        <p>
          In addition to saving placemarks or folders to your local computer, you can also save
          place data to a web server or network server. Other Google Earth users who have access to
          the server can then use the data. As with other documents, you can create links or
          references to KMZ files for easy access. Storing a placemark file on the network or on a
          web server offers the following advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility</strong> - If your place data is stored on a network or the Web,
            you can access it from any computer anywhere, provided the location is either publicly
            available or you have log in access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ease in Distribution</strong> - You can develop an extensive presentation
            folder for Google Earth software and make that presentation available to everyone who
            has access to your network storage location or web server. This is more convenient than
            sending the data via email when you want to make it persistently available to a large
            number of people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Updates/Network Link Access</strong> - Any new information or changes
            you make to network-based KMZ information is automatically available to all users who
            access the KML data via a network link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backup</strong> - If for some reason the data on your local computer is corrupt
            or lost, you can open any of the KMZ files that you have saved to a network location,
            and if so desired, save it as a local file again.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Before you can create a network link to an item in Google Earth,
          you must first store that place data on a server.

          Saving Data to a Server
        </h3>
        <p>
          To make your placemarks or folders available to other people via a server, you need to
          first save the file to the appropriate location.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Network Server</strong> - To save a folder or placemark to a location on your
            network, simply follow the steps in <a href="ug_places.html#saving">Saving Places
            Data</a> and save the file in a location on your company network rather than to your
            local file system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Server</strong> - To save a placemark or folder to a web server, first save
            the file to your local computer as described in <a href="ug_places.html#saving">Saving
            Places Data</a>. Once the file is saved on your local computer as a separate KMZ file,
            you can use an FTP or similar utility to transfer the file to the web servers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you want users to be able to open KML and KMZ files from a web server, you may need to
          add MIME types for the server. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml kml
          </li>
          <li>application/vnd.google-earth.kmz kmz
          </li>
        </ul><a id="openserver" name="openserver"></a>
        <h3>
          Opening Data from a Network Server
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are working in an organization where place data is saved to a network that you
          have access to, you can open that data in the same way you would open a saved KMZ file on
          your local computer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>From the File menu, select Open</strong> (Ctrl + O in Windows/Linux, <img alt=
            "Command/Open Apple Key" border="0" class="c3" height="14" src="images/mac-cmdkey.gif"
            width="14">+ O on the Mac) - Navigate to your network places and locate the KMZ or KML
            data you want to open in Google Earth. Select the file and click the <em>Open</em>
            button. The folder or placemark appears in the <em>Places</em> panel and the 3D viewer
            flies to the view set for the folder or placemark (if any).<br>
            <br>
            Files opened in this way are <em>NOT</em> automatically saved for the next time you use
            Google Earth. If you want the placemark or folder to appear the next time you use
            Google Earth, drag the item to your <em>My Places</em> folder to save it for the next
            session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Locate the file you want to open</strong> - Once you have located the file on
            your network places, you can simply drag and drop the KMZ file over the <em>Places</em>
            panel. The 3D viewer flies to the view set for the folder or placemark (if any).<br>
            <br>
            When you use the drag-and-drop method of opening a placemark or folder, you can drop
            the item over a specific folder in the <em>Places</em> panel. If the <em>My Places</em>
            folder is closed and you want to drop it there, just hold the item over the <em>My
            Places</em> folder until the folder opens up and you can place the item within
            subfolders or in the list. Items dropped in the <em>My Places</em> folder appear the
            next time you start Google Earth. Otherwise, you can drop the item in the white space
            below the <em>Places</em> panel so that it appears in the <em>Temporary Places</em>
            folder. Items opened this way appear only for the current session of Google Earth
            unless you save them.

          About Network Links
        </h3>
        <p>
          The network link feature in Google Earth provides a way for multiple clients to view the
          same network-based or web-based KMZ data and automatically see any changes to the content
          as those changes are made. A network link allows for content publishing in a manner
          similar to web page/web browser content delivery:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A network link provides a way to deliver dynamic data to multiple Google Earth
            users.</strong> When users connect to your KMZ file via a network link, either you or
            they can specify how often to refresh the data in the file. This way, regular updates
            made to the content by one person are automatically reflected in all connected clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A network link is intended as a view-only reference to published
            content</strong>. Just as web pages are viewed by many people but only modifiable by
            those with permission, place data content can be linked to and seen by multiple users
            while set to be modifiable only by one author. As with web pages, users who are viewing
            the content can always save that content to their hard drive, but they can only receive
            dynamic content via a network link.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following figure illustrates the parallels between web-based content and KMZ content
          via a network link using Google Earth.<br>

        <h3>
          Creating a Network Link
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before you can create a <a href="#createnetworklink">network link</a>, the content you
          want to link to must exist on the network or web server that you are linking to. If you
          are authoring the content, see <a href="#saveserver">Saving Data to a Server</a> for
          details about saving KMZ files to a web or network server. If you are only linking to the
          content, be sure you know either the network location of the file or the URL if it is
          located on a web server.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose any one of the following ways to start:
            <ul>
              <li>Select <em>Network Link</em> From the <em>Add</em> Menu. Select <em>Network
              Link</em> from the pop-up menu.
              </li>
              <li>Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on a folder in the <em>My Places</em> Panel.
              Select <em>Add &gt; Network Link</em> from the pop-up menu. When you add a network
              link in this way, the selected folder is automatically set as the container for the
              network link.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>The <em>New Network Link</em> dialog box appears. Enter the name of your link in
            the <em>Name</em> field. Enter the full path of the KMZ file in the <em>Link</em>
            field, or browse to the file location if the file is located on a network. You can use
            a URL to reference the KMZ, such as <em>http://www.test.com/myKMZ.kmz</em>. The 3D
            viewer immediately flies to the default view for the linked data.
          </li>
          <li>Enter descriptive text or HTML.You can enter this data in the same way you would for
          a regular folder. See <a href="ug_editing.html">Editing Places and Folders</a> for more
          information.
          </li>
          <li>(Optional) Click the View tab to change the default view that this network link
          presents to users. Click <em>Snapshot current view</em> to use your current view in
          Google Earth. If your network link has more than one placemark, click <em>Reset</em> to
          display all these placemarks to users.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - The text you enter in this description is your description of the
          link only and is not viewable by anyone else linking to the KMZ file. Only you will be
          able to see the description you enter here (unless you email your link folder to other
          people). This is similar to creating a bookmark for a web page and then adding a
          descriptive note about the bookmark.
