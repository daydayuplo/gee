          Using Style Templates
        </h2>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - This feature set is available to users of the Google Earth Pro
          product. Visit <a href=
          "http://earth.google.com/products.html">http://earth.google.com/products.html</a> for
          more information.
        </div>
        <p>
          Often the data you import into Google Earth contains multiple features that are not
          automatically converted into a readily visible feature in the 3D viewer. For example, a
          shape file defining the population boundaries for a specific region might have a field
          that supplies the population number for each boundary defined in the data. Or, a CSV file
          might contain real estate listings with a field showing the square footage of each
          listing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use style templates when importing this data in order to display fields in your
          data in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is accomplished by <em>mapping</em> or connecting specific fields in your imported
          data to one of four template display features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Name</em></strong> - By default, if a field for your data contains the
            phrase <em>name</em> as its label, Google Earth maps that field to the name displayed
            in the viewer for your point. However, you can map any field in your imported data to
            the <strong>Name</strong> element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Color</em></strong> - The color field applies color to your data. Icons are
            colored if you import point data, and shapes or lines are colored if you imported that
            type of data. For more information, see <a href="#mapcolor">Mapping Color Styles</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Icons</em></strong> - You can use the icon display feature to select an
            icon from the list for your imported point data. You can select a single icon for all
            point data, apply icons randomly, or select specific icons for specific fields. See
            <a href="#mapicons">Mapping Icons to Point Data</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Height</em></strong> - The height feature generates a height for the
            selected column in your data. If the selected data is numeric, height values can be
            spread across a range of values. If the data is text, icons can be supplied to
            individual fields. See <a href="#mapheight">Mapping Height Values</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        </h2>
        <p>
          This section covers the basic steps for applying a style template to vector data that
          contains fields you want to have displayed in the 3D viewer. You can apply style
          templates to newly ingested data or to existing KML data. In addition, you can modify
          existing templates using the steps below.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - Style templates are quite specific to the data you are working
          with. While you can use the same style template for different data that has the same
          fields, the template settings will often have to be adjusted to represent the data
          properly. As your original data set changes with new data, you might also need to adjust
          the template to accommodate new information.
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li value="1">
            <strong>Choose the data that will have the style template applied to it.</strong> If
            you are importing the data for the first time, simply click the <em>Yes</em> button
            when prompted to apply a style template.
          </li>
          <li value="2">If you already have this data in your <em>Places</em> panel, select the
          parent folder and click <em>Edit</em> &gt; <em>Apply Style Template</em>. (Use this
          method when you want to edit a recently-created style template.)
          </li>
          <li value="3">In the <em>Style Template Settings</em> dialog box, indicate whether you
          are creating a new template or using an existing one.
          </li>
          <li value="4">If you have an existing style template for your data, it appears in the
          <em>Compatible templates</em> list along with any other style template that is compatible
          to the data you have selected. If you choose to use an existing style template, select
          the correct one from the list. If you simply want to apply the template to your data
          without changing the template itself, leave the <em>edit selected template</em> check box
          clear. To edit the style template, select the check box.
          </li>
          <li value="5">When you create new template or edit an existing one, the <em>Style
          Template Settings</em> dialog box appears.
          </li>
          <li value="6">Choose a field from your data that you want to use as a Name, or label, for
          your data. This name appears in the 3D viewer as well as in the Places panel that lists
          the data points.
          </li>
          <li value="8">Click on the Color tab and map an element of your data to color styles. See

          The rest of this section discusses in detail how to apply template values to data.
          Finally, you can use the instructions in <a href="#example">A Style Template Example</a>
          to walk through the process of defining a style template on sample point data from a text
          file.

          <a id="mapcolor" name="mapcolor"></a>Mapping Color Styles
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can apply color to selected fields in your imported data. In this case, color is
          applied to the feature depending upon the type of data imported:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Icons</strong> are colored with point data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lines</strong> are colored when applying to lines or paths
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solid polygons</strong> are colored with shape data
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use the color style to color these elements in a meaningful way depending upon both the
          data type and the field data within the entire set. You can use three mechanisms to color
          data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a single color for all features
          </li>
          <li>Use random colors

        </h3>
        <p>
          While applying colors to data features helps distinguish features from each other in the
          3D viewer, using colors based on field values provides a way to display data about the
          feature set that you couldn't otherwise easily display. For example, you might want to
          set a short range of colors based on the square footage of real estate listings. Or, you
          might want to set a range of colors for shape files showing average household income.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the following steps to define color values by a data field.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the Set color from field option in the Color tab.
          </li>
          <li>Choose the field that you want to apply color data to from the Set color field
          drop-down list. Here, you can choose either numeric fields or text fields from your data.
          See <a href="#fieldtypes">Choosing Field Types for Style Mapping</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Choose the starting and ending color (optional) for your color mapping. By default,
          the style template "color buckets" are created from blue and mapped through the spectrum
          to red. If you want to change the color range, you can click on each color block and set
          the starting and ending colors as desired. Google Earth automatically calculates the
          color range between the two chosen values.

        </h3>
        <p>
          By default, no height values are defined initially in the <em>Height</em> tab. Use the
          <em>Height</em> tab in the <em>Style Template Settings</em> dialog box to set height
          values from a selected field. Once height values are activated, points, lines, or shapes
          are extruded from ground level to the height defined for each data element. If you map
          height to lines or shapes, the values you define work in combination with the colors
          defined in the <em>Color</em> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if you map height to point data, those points are extruded using a
          single pixel colored line to connect the icon from its elevated position to the ground.
          You can use style settings to modify the width and color of those lines if you wish.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The height map settings for text fields differ from those for numeric fields. If the
          field you choose to map contains text data, the first 8 unique fields are each defined in
          their own container, or bucket. For this reason, it makes sense to only map height values
          to a field that has 8 or fewer unique values. See <a href="#fieldtypes">Choosing Field
          Types for Style Mapping</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you map height values to a text field, the following settings are available:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual height values</strong> - The height mapping wizard automatically
            calculates reasonable height values for your data given its geographical extents. For
            example, for points clustered around a small region, 20 - 2000 meters might be adequate
            to view all points as elevated when looking at the entire set in the 3D viewer. On the
            other hand, if your data set encompasses an entire state, higher values are calculated
            so that height is apparent when looking over the entire region in the 3D viewer.<br>
            <br>
            You can always modify the height values by hand to adjust each point to your
            preference. In general, the greater the distinction between each point, the easier it
            is to visualize that distinction in the 3D viewer from a distance. <strong>Height
            units</strong> - By default, height units are set to meters, but you can change them to
            feet if you prefer. When you change the default value from meters to feet, you might
            want to adjust the values in each bucket upward to make the data visible in the 3D
            viewer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scaling factor</strong> - Use the <em>Scaling factor</em> slider to uniformly
            adjust the numeric values in all height fields. The slider provides a general factor
            from .1 times the value to 10 times the value defined in each field. If you manually
            adjust the height values, you can also use the <em>Scaling factor</em> slider to make
            further adjustments to those numbers.

        </ul>
        <h3>
          <a id="heightnumeric" name="heightnumeric"></a>Height Values for Numeric Fields
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you map height values to a numeric field in your data, you can choose from two types
          of mapping methods: <em><a href="#continuous">continuous</a></em> or <em><a href=
          "#split">split into buckets</a></em>.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <a id="continuous" name="continuous"></a>Using Continuous Mapping
        </h4>
        <p>
          The continuous mapping method uses the minimum and maximum values of your selected field
          to determine a minimum and maximum height display for the entire set. It then maps all
          data within the set in a way that best corresponds to each individual field. In the
          example, the <em>Square_footage</em> field is used to map height values, with the minimum
          value of 2000 and a maximum value of 6234. Each of the 9 elements in the set is displayed
          at a slightly different height value that most accurately displays its relationship to
          the other points. This particular method is useful in smaller data sets where individual
          distinctions between points or shapes are easily visualized.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the continuous mapping method, you can use the <em>Scaling factor</em> slider and
          the <em>Height units</em> selector as described above in <a href="#heighttext">Height
          Values for Text Fields</a>. Additionally, you can enter the desired height you want for
          the beginning and ending ranges of your data. For example, you might want houses starting
          at 2000 feet to be displayed in the 3D viewer at a height of 100 meters, and houses at
          the ending range to be displayed at a height of 5000 meters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 3D viewer, the visual distinction between individual elements using this method is
          affected by both the height range you set and by the number of elements in the data. For
          example, a range of 100 - 5000 meters for a set containing only 9 elements creates a
          visually distinct height for each point.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decrease the range or increase the number of elements in the set, the distinction
          between each element diminishes.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <a id="split" name="split"></a>Splitting Values into Buckets
        </h4>
        <p>
          Use the <em>Split into buckets</em> mapping method to create up to 8 height groupings for
          your data. This method works well for large data sets where continuously mapped heights
          are not easily visualized in the 3D viewer. For example, if your data set contains over
          1000 housing listings clustered around a small region, it might be difficult to see the
          actual difference between houses in different height categories. By using the <em>Split
          into buckets</em> option, you can create more meaningful categories and define visually
          distinct gaps in their display. For example, you might have all listings between 2000 -
          3000 square feet display at a height of 500 meters, all listings between 3000 - 4000
          square feet display at a height of 1500 meters, and so on. While this method will not
          distinguish a house at 3000 square feet from one at 3200 square feet, it will allow a
          more immediate visual grasp of the categories you have defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with color and icon styles, the maximum value for each bucket is automatically
          computed, but can be adjusted manually. Use the <em>Scaling factor</em> slider and the
          <em>Height units</em> selector for this method as described above in <a href=
          "#heighttext">Height Values for Text Fields</a>. As you set the number of buckets and
          define the maximum value for each bucket, the Style Template wizard displays the count of
          items for each bucket. For more details, see <a href="#buckets">Using Buckets for Field
          Data</a>.

        <p>
          The color values you set for point data are applied to the icon that you map to points as
          well as to the line that is extruded from the point on the earth for the height of the
          line, as shown in the real estate listing example above. However, in some cases it might
          not be easy to visualize a single-pixel line in the 3D viewer against the earth imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that case, you can edit the style settings for each point in order to modify the line
          thickness.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Right-click (CTRL click on the Mac) on the point you want to modify and select

        <p>
          Since this process is not practical for large data sets, you might consider applying
          changes to entire folders or subfolders. Beware that if you do this, any individually
          defined styles will be lost. In this case, use the sub-folder feature of the <em>Style
          Template</em> wizard to group similarly styled data into subfolders. Make sure that each
          folder created has similar color and icon data. Then, apply the height value to your data
          and save the style template. Later, use the steps above to create shared styles for each
          subfolder you set up. As long as all of the data within each folder has the same color
          value and the same icon value, changes to the line thickness will not impact those
          settings.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Text (string) fields</strong> - If the field that you map to color or other
            style contains non-numeric data (i.e., text and other characters), the application
            looks for the <em>first 8 unique</em> text fields, and maps those fields to the style.
            If there are fewer than 8 values in your data, each unique value is paired to a
            different color, icon, or height. If there are more than 8 values, the first 8 unique
            values are mapped to a style, and the rest of the values are grouped together and
            mapped to a ninth style. For this reason, it typically is most useful to apply a style
            to text fields that contain <em>small unique sets</em>.<br>
            <br>
            For example, in the real estate example described in <a href="#example">A Style
            Template Example</a>, there is a field in the data called <em>School_district</em>.
            This field defines the school district ratings for each listed house. Because there are
            only three districts: <em>AA</em>, <em>AAA</em>, and <em>AAAA</em>, it makes sense to
            use a style to distinguish this type of text field. You might, for instance, decide to
            map a height to this field, so that users viewing your data see the highest points as
            those belonging to houses in the highest-rated districts, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Numeric field</strong> - If the field that you choose contains numeric data,
            the application automatically apportions the numeric data across the number of buckets
            that you select, and provides a count of items in each bucket. If you increase or
            decrease the number of buckets, the application automatically re-apportions the number
            of elements for each bucket.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>&nbsp;
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong> - If you are using a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft
          Excel to create your data, be sure that the cell format you choose for numeric fields has
          been set to <em>numeric</em> and not text. If you have numeric fields in your CSV saved
          from a spreadsheet, but the <em>Style Template</em> wizard is not recognizing it as
          numeric, it might be due to incorrect formatting. To verify whether the actual field is
          marked as text or numeric, open the CSV file in a simple text editor and look at the
          field in question. If it is enclosed in double quotation marks, then it has been defined
          as text &mdash; even if there are only numbers within the quotations. You can remove the
          quotation marks manually from the file, or open your spreadsheet application and format
          the cells as numeric and save the CSV data again.

        <h2>
          <a id="customizerange" name="customizerange"></a>Customizing the Value Ranges for Numeric
          Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          Typically, you will want to customize the numeric values to define buckets in ranges that
          are more meaningful for your data. For example, you might modify the ranges displayed in
          the example above to round figures typically used to describe square footage for houses.
          To do this, simply enter the values you want as the maximum value for each bucket. As you
          do this, the number of elements contained by the new definition updates to reflect your
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind the following about how to adjust numeric field values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>You cannot adjust the minimum value for the set, nor the maximum
            value.</strong> This means that the range for the last bucket is actually defined by
            the maximum value of the previous bucket. In the example above, then, if you want to
            change the last bucket to contain 4 items, you would decrease the maximum value of the
            green bucket until the <em>Count</em> field showed 4. <strong>You must adjust the
            values for each bucket so as not to collide with the values defined for other
            buckets.</strong> When organizing your data into buckets, it's easiest to sketch your
            bucket values down first before attempting to adjust them in the <em>Bucket
            options</em> fields, or to start at one end of the data set and work toward the other.
            You cannot enter a value in one bucket that is either greater than the maximum value of
            the next bucket, or less than the maximum value of the previous bucket.<br>
            <br>
            For example, in the first color bucket example above, suppose you know that you want
            your first bucket to show all houses with a square footage of 5000 or less, and you
            want the second bucket to show a narrow range of houses from 5000 to 5500 square feet.
            If you enter the number 5000 next to the first bucket, you will receive an alert asking
            you to pick a number between 2000 and 4822.67. Because the maximum value of the next
            higher bucket is 4822.67, you cannot enter a value in the previous bucket that exceeds
            it. Thus, to accomplish your goal, you would first need to adjust the second bucket's
            maximum value to 5500. At that point, you could adjust the value of the first bucket to
            5000.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Field data whose numbers exceed a certain number of digits might display in
            scientific notation.</strong> Depending upon the size of the input box on your screen,
            some larger numbers (such as those exceeding 6 digits) will display in scientific
            notation. For example, you might see the number <em>1,628,000</em> displayed as
            <em>1.628e+06</em>. If you move the decimal point over 6 places, you will obtain the
            number in regular notation.

          In this section, you will supply a name label to the real estate listings and color code
          the listings based on the <em>Square_footage</em> field. After that, you will save the
          template and view your settings.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>With the Style Template Options dialog box open, be sure the Name tab is active.
          </li>
          <li>Click the black arrow next to the Set name field selector.
          </li>
          <li>Choose the first field in the list, Address.<br>
            <br>
            Notice how the preview table shows the Address column as selected. You can also click
            on the column heading of any column in the preview table to change your choice. When
            you are finished, be sure the Address column is the selected element for the Name
            field.
          </li>
          <li>Click the Color tab. Notice how the default setting here is to use a single color for
          the point data, and that the color is set to white.
          </li>
          <li>Select the Set color from field option.
          </li>
          <li>From the Select color field selector, choose Square_footage as the field. Again, you
          can see how the <em>Square_footage</em> column is selected as the chosen field in the
          data preview table.
          </li>
          <li>Adjust the color range to your preference. For instance, suppose you want graduations
          of a single color red from light to dark. Click the color square next to Palette start
          color and choose white in the color picker dialog box. Since the default ending color is
          already red, you can leave that square as it is. The color range gradient will update to
          reflect your new choice.<br>

            </ul>Notice the slight adjustment in the count fields.
          </li>
          <li>Provide meaningful folder names for each bucket. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>2000 - 3000 Square Feet
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>Leave this name as it is, and click the Save button. The 3D viewer adjusts to
          encompass all the points in the data file. Notice that the number of blue icons
          corresponds to the count next to the blue bucket and so on for all three buckets (3 blue,
          2 green, 3 red).
          </li>
          <li>In the Temporary Places folder within the Places panel, expand both parent folders
          until you see the three subfolders you created in the steps above.<br>
            <br>
            You can turn off the display of all houses contained within a given folder simply by
            removing the check mark next to that folder.<br>
            <br>
            You can also adjust the ordering of the folders by dragging the <em>3000 - 4000 Square
            Feet</em> folder to the space between the two remaining folders, so that the order
            appears in sequence.
          </li>
