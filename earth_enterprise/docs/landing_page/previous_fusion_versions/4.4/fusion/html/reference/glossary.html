</h3>
<p>The process that determines whether an authenticated user, system, or process has permission to perform a task.
</p>
<h2>B
</h2>
<h3>Bad Features
</h3>
<p>Feature whose geometry is not available in the underlying source file. This could result from a corrupted source file or, more likely, from a source file that is missing the geometry for some of the records.
</p>
<h3><a id="marker-1016467"></a>Blocked
</h3>
<p>There is a canceled or failed resource that your project or database requires to be completed. You must resolve the problems with these resources before the project or database can successfully complete a build.
</p>
<h3>Build
</h3>
<p>The process of preparing one or more assets for inclusion in a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion database.
</p>
<h2>C
</h2>
<h3>Clean
</h3>
<p>The process of removing an asset version, making it unavailable for further use in a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion project or database, even though it still appears on the asset list in the Asset Manager.
</p>
<h3>Controlled Access
</h3>
<p>Refers to any content or process that requires successful authentication and authorization.
</p>
<h2>D
</h2>
<h3><a id="marker-1014623"></a>Database
</h3>
<p>An organized body of related information. The final form of a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data set that is ready to be published to a Google Earth server; can be either a map database or a Google Earth database.
</p>
<h3>Define
</h3>
<p>The process of creating an asset and adding source data or other assets to it. For example, when you define a project, you create it and add resources to it.
</p>
<h3>Display Level
</h3>
<p>Determines the level at which each layer is visible to users in Google Earth EC. The lower the number, the higher the level at which Google Earth EC users can view the data. Value can range from 2 to 24. The entire Earth can be viewed at level 5. (Also referred to as LOD.)
</p>
<h3>Display Rule
</h3>
<p>Determines exactly which feature(s) of the layer are displayed and how Google Earth displays them. Display rules consist of several options you can set, including colors, fonts, display levels, and so on.
</p>
<h2>E
</h2>
<h3>Extents
</h3>
<p>The outer boundaries of individual resources or source files.
</p>
<h2>F
</h2>
<h3>Favorite
</h3>
<p>A particular location on and orientation to the Earth that you use frequently. You can save a favorite and then return to that view in the Preview pane next time by simply selecting the favorite.
</p>
<h3>Fill Pixels
</h3>
<p>Extra pixels (often pure black or pure white) that produce a frame around imagery where its borders are uneven.
</p>
<h3>Filter (vector)
</h3>
<p>A pattern expression that is applied to the data fields of the vector resource. 
</p>
<h3 id="flat_projection">Flat Projection</h3>
<p>Also known as plate carr√©e, equirectangular, or
equidistant cylindrical projection, uses the equator as the standard
parallel, and maps meridians and circles of latitude to vertical and
horizontal straight lines, respectively. </p>
<p>In Google Earth Enterprise,
   Flat Projection is used for Earth databases and (optionally) Maps databases.
   Flat projection imagery is not compatible with <strong>maps.google.com</strong> base
   imagery. To use <strong>maps.google.com</strong> base imagery,
   you will need to create Mercator projection imagery resources.</p>
 
<h2>G</h2>
<h3>GIS
</h3>
<p>An organized collection of computer hardware, software, geographic data, and personnel designed to efficiently capture, store, update, manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced information.
</p>
<h3>Grid
</h3>
<p>A configuration of networked workstations, servers, and storage devices that share the work and data storage in Google Earth Enterprise Fusion.
</p>
<h2>I
</h2>
<h3>Imagery
</h3>
<p>High-resolution overhead photographs captured by satellites or from airplanes.
</p>
<h3>Inset
</h3>
<p>An individual source image within an imagery or terrain resource.
</p>
<h2>L
</h2>
<h3>Layer
</h3>
<p>An individual vector resource within a vector project.
</p>
<h3>LOD
</h3>
<p>Level of Detail. Also referred to as display level. Determines the level at which each layer is visible to users in Google Earth EC.
</p>
<h2>M
</h2>
<h3>Map Layer
</h3>
<p>A special component in the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data set that you use in map data sets.
</p>
<h3>Mask
</h3>
<p>An opaque graphical layer used to conceal part of an image.
</p>
<h3 id="mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</h3>
<p>A cylindrical map projection, commonly used for
nautical purposes. Mercator Projections preserve shapes and
directions, but distort size, especially as latitudes approach the
poles. <strong>maps.google.com</strong> uses the Mercator projection. </p>
<p>In Google Earth
   Enterprise, you can create imagery resources in
   the Mercator Projection to integrate your data with the   <strong>maps.google.com</strong> base maps. However, if you
   are creating both Maps and Earth databases, you will need two copies of the
   imagery resources: one for Mercator and one for Flat projection.</p>
<h3>Minification
</h3>
<p>The method used to determine the texture color for a texture mapped pixel, using the colors of nearby texels (pixels of the texture). In short, it blends the texture pixels together by breaking them up into tinier pixels. Another term for texture filtering is called texture smoothing.
</p>
<h3>Mosaic
</h3>
<p>A single composite image created by assembling multiple images.
</p>
<h2>P
</h2>
<h3>Plug-in
</h3>
<p>A self-contained software component that modifies (adds or changes) function in a particular software system. When you add a plug-in to Google Earth Enterprise Fusion, the foundation of the original software system remains intact. The development of plug-ins requires well defined application programming interfaces (APIs).
</p>
<h3>Preserve Text
</h3>
<p>The level at which you want to preserve text labels on roads after the vector data for the road itself fades away.
</p>
<h3>Preview
</h3>
<p>To view source data before you import it as a resource, or to view Google Earth Enterprise Fusion assets before you publish them to Google Earth EC.
</p>
<h3><a id="marker-1014624"></a>Project
</h3>
<p>The intermediate component of a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data set; can be created from one or more resources; however, the resources must be of the same type as the project (imagery, terrain, vector, or map layer).
</p>
<h3>Provider
</h3>
<p>An organization that distributes source imagery, terrain, or vector data.
</p>
<h3>Publish
</h3>
<p>The process of making a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion database available on a Google Earth Enterprise Server for viewing with Google Earth EC.
</p>
<h2>R
</h2>
<h3>Raster Data
</h3>
<p>A method of storing, representing, or displaying spatial data in digital form. It consists of using cell data (not necessarily square) arranged in a regular grid pattern in which each unit (pixel or cell) within the grid is assigned an identifying value based on its characteristics.
</p>
<h3><a id="marker-1014625"></a>Resource
</h3>
<p>The most basic component of a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data set; can be created from imagery, terrain, or vector source data.
</p>
<h2>S

</p>
<h2>T
</h2>
<h3>Template
</h3>
<p>A file external to Google Earth Enterprise Fusion that contains a set of display rules. You can import the template and reapply those display rules to layers in any project.
</p>
<h3>Terrain
</h3>
<p>Topographical information about a geographic area.
</p>
<h3>Tile
</h3>
<p>The equivalent of one grid square. (See <a href="fundamentals.html#74193">The Toolbar</a> in the <strong>Fundamentals</strong> chapter for more information about turning the grid on and off.) </p>
<h2>V
</h2>
<h3>Vector
</h3>
<p>A method of storing, representing, or displaying spatial data in digital form. It consists of using coordinate pairs (x,y) to represent locations on the Earth. Features can take the form of single points, lines, arcs, or closed lines (polygons).
</p>
<h3>Version
</h3>
<p>A particular instance of a build of an asset.
</p>
