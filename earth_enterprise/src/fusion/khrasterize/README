Usage: khrasterize [options] -r target_resolution -i xyz_file [-o bil_file] 
Options:
         -q : quiet mode
         -f : fill radius (default=3)
         -m : interpolation method
              0: Nearest Neighbor (default)
              1: Linear

The input XYZ file contains comma separated 3D coordinates

Example: khrasterize -r 0.0001 -i sample.xyz
(the sample.xyz is provided with this utility)

Currently it only supports input coordinates in WGS84
Lat/Lon and the target resolution needs to be provided by the user
in degrees.
