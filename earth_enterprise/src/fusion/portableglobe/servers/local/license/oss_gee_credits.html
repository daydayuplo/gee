<h3>JPEG is licensed as follows:</h3>
<strong>Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software</strong>

<p>This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color
and gray-scale images.

<p>The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and
image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.  The
core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable C code;
we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

<p>We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.
