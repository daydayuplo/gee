Tool for installing Fusion and Earth Server, building tutorial databases (2d, 3d, and 3d Time Machine), and running tests against these databases.

The clean is harsh so you should not use it on machines where you want to save your work.

The test program does not work unless the asset root /usr/local/google/gevol_test already exists. This seems to be an issue with the clean install. If it fails, you will have to run:
sudo /opt/google/bin/geconfigureassetroot --new --assetroot  /usr/local/google/gevol_test/assets
# You can add source volumes:
/usr/local/google/gevol_test/src
/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion

sudo /opt/google/bin/geselectassetroot --assetroot  /usr/local/google/gevol_test/assets


Asset root:
  /usr/local/google/gevol_test/assets

Publish root:
  /usr/local/google/gevol_test/published_db


Examples:

To do a basic install and test:

./gee_test.py <path-to-installer-tarball>

or

./gee_test.py <path-to-installer-directory>


To install without building tutorial dbs:

./gee_test.py --notutorial --nopublish --notests <path-to-installer-tarball>


To do a clean install with tests:

./gee_test.py --clean --uninstall <path-to-installer-directory>

To run only tests:

./gee_test.py --noserver --nofusion --notutorial --nopublish <path-to-installer-directory>
