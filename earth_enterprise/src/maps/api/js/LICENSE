General Google API Restrictions

The following restrictions apply generally to all Google Services, including
the Google application programming interfaces at
https://developers.google.com/products/
(or such other URL as Google may provide) (the “Google API(s)”). You will not:

a. Sublicense a Google API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not
create an API client that functions substantially the same as the Google APIs
and offer it for use by third parties.

b. Perform an action with the intent of introducing to Google Services any
viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive
nature.

c. Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.

d. Interfere with or disrupt the Google APIs or the servers or networks
providing the Google APIs.

e. Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial
messages or advertisements.

f. Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any Google API
or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly
prohibited by applicable law.

g. Use the Google APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the Google
APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the
operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).

h. Use the Google APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of
State.

i. Remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service, or any links to or
notices of those terms.
