############### LDAP authentication for publisher ###################

# This is an example of how to enable LDAP authentication for
# publishing. You may choose a different authentication method and also
# different auth types for stream and search publishers.
# Since Basic authentication is used for password challenge, it is
# advisable to publish via an SSL tunnel. Please refer to the admin guide for
# instructions on how to do that.
# Uncomment the following lines to enable Stream Publisher LDAP authentication.

#<Location /StreamPublisher/>
#  AuthType Basic
#  AuthName "Publisher"
#  AuthBasicProvider ldap
#  AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off
#  AuthLDAPURL " <<LDAP_SERVER_URL_and_LDAP_SEARCH_PARAMETERS>>"
#  require valid-user
#</Location>

# Uncomment the following lines to enable Search Publisher LDAP authentication.
#<Location /SearchPublisher/>
#  AuthType Basic
#  AuthName "Publisher"
#  AuthBasicProvider ldap
#  AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off
#  AuthLDAPURL "<<LDAP_SERVER_URL_and_LDAP_SEARCH_PARAMETERS>>"
#  require valid-user
#</Location>
