It handles 1.1.1 and 1.3.0, though they're both untested against clients, for different reasons.
(I use specific versions of Earth's radius, and the maximum legal latitude, both
are defined in projections.py. You may want to tweak these to get it to work with
different clients; uDig always jumps past the 90^ latitude limit; I played with
the values a bit but it didn't seem to help.)

It doesn't have correct (or any) Service Exceptions.

I haven't tried vector layers at all, I don't know what different those will make.

Note that this uses /mapping space/ coordinates, not lat/lons as with flat.
This space goes from 0,0 at the equator + Greenwich Meridian, out to:
  CRS="EPSG:3857"
  minx="-20037508.3428" miny="-20037508.3428"
  maxx="20037508.3428" maxy="20037508.3428"

Since this range is unwieldy, if you're playing with it by url
you can change the radius value in projections.py, there's a
convenient number there.

Some example urls:

# no version -> should give the 1.3.0 GetCapabilities
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
# 1.3.0
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=1.3.0
# 1.1.1
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=1.1.1

# A small chunk centered around the origin, just under Africa's West bulb.
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?LAYERS=s0-1002&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&SRS=EPSG:3857&BBOX=-4000000.0,-4000000.0,4000000.0,4000000.0&WIDTH=500&HEIGHT=500

# bigger chunk, same center
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?LAYERS=s0-1002&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&CRS=EPSG:3857&BBOX=-9000000.0,-9000000.0,9000000.0,9000000.0&WIDTH=400&HEIGHT=400

# Top half of the world, runs over the pole and shows black there.
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?LAYERS=s0-1002&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&SRS=EPSG:3857&BBOX=-9000000.0,0.0,9000000.0,40000000.0&WIDTH=400&HEIGHT=400

# Middle quarter of the top half of the world, going over pole a bit.
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/ogc/service.py?LAYERS=s0-1002&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&CRS=EPSG:3857&BBOX=-4000000.0,0.0,4000000.0,25000000.0&WIDTH=500&HEIGHT=500

The form for the GetMap query is the same between 1.1.1 and 1.3.0 (at least if you don't add bells and whistles) and both work.


# There are others, but one WMS server I've used as a model is this, which handles both 1.1.1 and 1.3.0

Changes: arithmetic corrected, and a lot of error checking added.

# 10.04 Ubuntu libraries, to compile mapserv:
  libgdal1-dev
  libproj-dev

# To just run it:
  libgdal1-1.6.0
  libproj0

The list might be incomplete, in which case these are the
installation instructions:
  http://mapserver.org/installation/unix.html#unix

(You might need libpng-dev, I'm not sure.)

Note that:
  /usr/share/proj/epsg
comes from the
  proj-data
package, (which might be included with either
libgdal or libproj), but I found that mapserv didn't find it as lowercase.
If you rename or link it to uppercase (EPSG) it'll be fine.
The MapServerInstallation.tar.gz bundle includes a link.

FWIW here was how I configured mapserv (if it helps with library dependencies):

  ./configure --with-wmsclient --with-gdal --with-proj --with-png --with-jpeg \
      --enable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/MapServer

Then just copy $installdir/bin/mapserv into /opt/google/gehttpd/cgi-bin
But MapServerInstallation.tar.gz has the binary.

The 1.1.1 GetCapabilities and ServiceException xml types have not been
validated; I'm not sure how except by specifying version 1.1.1 in wms
clients and seeing whether it works. For one thing, one of the urls in
the namespace definition no longer exists. Possibly some desktop tool
might be able to do it, too. 1.3.0 is fine, the new-style .xsd -
generated files contain all the information they need to validate
themselves, and that's been done against the W3C's online validator.

Portable doesn't work. It's closer than it was but, that needs doing,
still.
